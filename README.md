# WS4JWebWrapper

This is a very simple (and should be easy to use) wrapper of ws4j web demo: http://ws4jdemo.appspot.com/. As long as the web demo works, this wrapper should work.

The reason to create this wrapper is because the web demo of ws4j has some bugs fixed over the released v1.0.1 jar file, and also way faster than it. Since I have no idea when the author Hideki Shima will release new version of ws4j jar file, and there seems to be no way to find the updated working code. Grabbing results from the web demo seems to be the "best" solution for now.
